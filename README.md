# ScalingSkillLimits

Scaling Skill Limits changes the skill Deployment Point (DP) limit effects to be derived from the maximum battle size set in the settings. The values in vanilla are based on a battle size of 400 as per 0.95.1a patch notes. Incidentally, the total number of allowed officers in the player fleet is adjusted as well.
